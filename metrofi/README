This data was collected by Caleb Phillips and Russell Senior to determine the
coverage and performance of a 802.11x municipal wireless mesh network in Portland, Oregon
in 2007. It contains three pieces of data:

1) aps.txt: Locations and MAC addresses of APs

2) stumble_filtered.txt: Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) 
   observations of the APs from an exhaustive war-driving campaign
   in the network's service area. To turn RSSI into something like
   Received Signal Strength (RSS) in dBm, simply subtract 95.

3) random.csv: Performance results at a random sample of points
   within the coverage area. The fields should be fairly 
   straight-forward.

Quickly, this dataset was collected with a linux-based sniffer using
a Kismet instance configured to channel hop on all 11 channels. The wireless
interface was an atheros chipset using the madwifi driver. The 72 functional APs were located
using triangulation and then fine-tuned with a hand-held GPS device. All measurements
are passive, with no special access to the network. This network is now defunct
(the operator subsequently went bankrupt) and all the APs have been dismantled. Hence,
we have performed no anonymization as there is no conceivable privacy/anonymity risk
to anyone or anything.

For more information on how the data was collected, please see the original

Although this data has been available freely online since 2007, it is being
released on CRAWDAD for archival purposes.
